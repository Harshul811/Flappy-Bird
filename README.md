# Flappy-Bird

Flappy Bird is a side-scrolling mobile game featuring 2D retro style graphics. The objective was to direct a flying bird, named “Faby”, who moves continuously to the right, between sets of Mario-like pipes. If the player touches the pipes, they lose. Faby briefly flaps upward each time that the player taps the screen; if the screen is not tapped, Faby falls because of gravity; each pair of pipes that he navigates between earns the player a single point, with medals awarded for the score at the end of the game.
